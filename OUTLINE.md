# Outline (rough draft)

## Intro section
- Clarifications/pre-amble
## The negatives of life section
- It’s weird to start with negativity, but these chapters are intended to be short and vague in hopes to appeal to the reader’s own life issues, and that they can be dealt with (This helps frame the remainder of the book as “issues with you [the reader]” and not issues the author has.) 
### Interpersonal communications gone wrong 
- Discussion on how being ostracized from their peer groups, and have feelings of loneliness, despair, etc… 
- There very well may be many of these nowadays caused by social media anger.
### Stress/Overwork
- List common factors, such as work stress, and benefits of stress like how it can motivate you to get more done.
### Finding the self
- Bringing it back to a semi-positive message that other’s opinions do not matter, as much as our own.

>Conclusion: Since we value our own opinion of ourself, and we control our opinion … we might as well choose not to the negative against ourself./

## The positive of life section
### Meditation
- Give examples of each, these are solo activities which are easily practiced and can bring the reader who is isolated a feeling of control in their life
- Zazen/Zen meditation  (doing a task and being fully involved)
- Vipassana (mindfullness breathing exercises)
- Metta (Along with vipassana, a way to create the emotion of happiness and love)
- Mindfullness, everyday living in the “now” and being aware of yourself. A critical skill to learn for the self-helping reader.
### Exercise 
- Working off the above, exercise is another example of solo control in one’s own life. 
- There is opportunity here to allow them to begin rebuilding social networks (yoga classes, running 5k events, gym friends, etc…)
 - Yoga
 - Running, Walking or Hiking
 - Weights (bodyweight or actual)
 - Recovery (sleep/eating)
## Eating Healthy 
- A separate topic, but related to exercise. It’s important the reader doesn’t feel dismayed by over-exercising and eating unhealthy.
- Secondarily, there is plenty of evidence that maintaining a healthy diet improves mood.
 -- Meal planning (helps you stick to it)
 -- Avoiding seeking pleasure from food (unless it’s controlled)
 -- Avoiding food items that cause negative emotions (back to mindfullness)
### Addictions 
- With a foundation of exercise and healthy habits hopefully growing, we can address if the reader has any addiction issues. 
- The healthy habits we’ve begun to work on building in the previous chapters hopefully will become a replacement for any unhealthy addictive behaviors (not wanting to drink late to go to the gym, getting mental “releases” or breaks from achieving physical health goals.
- Addictions can be anything from:
-- Alcohol
-- Drugs
-- Caffeine
-- Sugar
-- Social Media
- It will be clarified that it’s up to the reader to decide what a negative addiction is, and their usage of mindfulness is important here.
### How to seek out therapy (therapy styles, accepting if they’re not the right fit)
- Where this book lacks, therapy fills the gap. The one-on-one engagement to help you sort out your problems, is something a book can never replace.
- Therapy is of critical importance for anyone at risk, or anyone still feeling down or unconnected with their peers.
- The chapter will clarify types of therapy, and break it down so that a reader who needs therapy will feel no fear in the process of approaching a therapist.
### Helping others (only after helping yourself)
- An important chapter to end on, with the reader’s outlook beginning to turn positive, and with their self confidence boosted, they can begin working with others again, volunteering, creating new events, etc.. giving back and being an ally to those in need.
- This creates the feeling of “community” which the reader may have lost before picking up the book (back to chapter 1)
- Importantly, their self confidence should be stronger and they will understand more about themselves now than ever. 
- The mindfulness practice is important to keep with them them so they can detect when things start not working out again, and cut it off in the future before they’re left unhappy , frustrated and alone.

> The hope of the book and it’s margins/exercises is that if the reader finds themselves unhappy again, they can re-use the book (with their own notes included in the chapter margins) to know they can go through the steps all over again, and briskly walk away from a bad situation and start working on themselves again.

I hope to teach people to fish and feed their need for help for a lifetime, not just give them temporary help today.
