# Why

There is a tide of self-help/mental-health courses, initiatives and helpers out there today ... but even in this flood of resources to address mental health, the underlying problem of mental health and unhappiness still remains in many sub-cultures in society, who these books are not well tailored for.

Many of the books I have read on happiness or mental health tackle the problem by the author just stating “This is what I did!” Then fill hundreds of pages with unimpressive details of the author’s daily life, with an expectation the readers should pick and choose the things they feel best resonate with them. 

The readers gain a few anecdotal tips, but when the examples from the book diminish in effectiveness the reader has to find yet another book for inspiration for activities to make them feel happy. In this, the cycle of self-help addiction begins , leaving the reader with shelves full of books they used to try to fill the void inside them. 

This "authority approach" to mental health (do as I do)  may work for some, but there is a significant lack of books which are manuals on training people on how to help themselves.  The authority approach is specifically counter productive within anti-authority sub-cultures (like hackers), anti-authoritarian personality types reading about someone else’s happy life experiences just provides a feeling of contempt towards the author not happiness within themselves.

I want to fill this gap in mental health books, and show everyone (even anti-authoritarian types) how to “Help you, help yourself.”

Topics would be centric on actions/activities the reader should take, unlike the books above it will not be about the author’s experiences, but intended for the reader to be mindful about their feelings as they work through the exercises.

To appeal to both crowds, each chapter would be constructed in a manner where first a basic story is told (ambiguously, so as not to irk the ire of the reader that the author is any better than them) then go into details of the subject manner, finally end with the exercises which allow the reader to act upon and write down their personal reflections for each exercise/chapter (more on the importance of that is in the last chapter.)
